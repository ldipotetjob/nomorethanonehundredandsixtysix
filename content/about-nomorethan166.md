No more than 166 is a technical site, completely limited to scala specification in which if you delete texts and comments you will get a piece of code with no more than 166 lines . It's just Scala by its specification.
Each specification comes with a clear example and only one objective: to make everything as easy as possible.
The Scala specification can be found at:

* Scala specifications [repos](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/).

The proper version of scala specification is indicated on each post.
