No more than 166 is a technical site, completely limited to scala specification and in which there is no article with more than 160 lines if you delete texts and comments. It's just Scala by its specification.
Each specification come with a clear example and only one objective: to make everything as easy as possible.
The Scala specification can be found at:

* Scala specifications [repos](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/).

So in the previous url you can find all the specifications of Scala.
The proper version of scala specification is indicated in each post.
